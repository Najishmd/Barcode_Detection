# Barcode_Detection
Detecting barcode for various logistics companies

This project aimed to streamline logistical tasks by automating the identification of barcodes within images.

The Barcode Detection project involved several key components and Digital Image Processing techniques:
1. **Image Acquisition**: I started by acquiring images that contained barcodes. These images 
could be from various sources, including cameras or scanners.
2. **Image Enhancement:** To improve the quality of the images and make barcode detection more 
robust, we applied techniques like Gaussian Blurring to reduce noise and enhance image 
clarity.
3. **Image Compression:** To optimize the storage and processing of images, we explored image 
compression techniques to reduce the size of the images without sacrificing quality.
4. **Image Analysis:** The core of the project revolved around image analysis. We used techniques 
such as finding intensity ranges using Sobel Kernels to highlight edges and contours within the 
images.
5. **Thresholding:** Thresholding was employed to segment the barcode region from the 
background, making it easier to identify and analyze the barcode.
6. **Morphological Operations**: We utilized morphological operations like closing, erosion, and 
dilation to further refine the detected barcode area, ensuring accuracy and completeness.
7. **Contour Detection:** Finally, we used contour detection to precisely locate and extract the 
barcode within the processed image
